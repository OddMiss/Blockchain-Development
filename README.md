- Some hackathons: chainlink, global, Dev folio

# Session 1, Basis

- Smart Contract
- Different between Bitcoin and Etherium protocol
- Oracle Problem
- **Use decentralized oracle to build decentralized blockchain**
- On-chain decentralized logic with off-chain decentralized data and computation called hybrid smart contracts
- Use "Smart Contract Platform" and "Blockchain" interchangeably
- Chainlink: the most polular and powerful decentralized Oracle network
- Dapp = Decentralized Application (Combination of smart contract) = Decentralized Protocol = Smart Contract
- Web 1, Web2, Web3
- (‚ùì) censorship / decentralized censorship (16:54)
- Main purpose: **Trust minimized agreements**

> Nearly everything in life is the result of an agreement or a contract (19:09). Smart Contract will solve society's critical trust issues (28:05)

- Decentralized Exchange
- DeFi

(2025.10.9)

- DAOs
- NFTs

# Session 2, Transaction Info

- Transaction in test Ethereum chain
- Mnemonic
- Private Key

> Test Phrase
> 
> 1. prize
> 2. modify
> 3. frown
> 4. ethics
> 5. hammer
> 6. dress
> 7. employ
> 8. sick
> 9. shield
> 10. indoor
> 11. brand
> 12. useless

- Rinkeby is the most popular test network (Be sure to follow the last update in Github repository) (It is stopped currently.)
- Sepolia test network: https://sepolia.etherscan.io/
- Faucet

- Transaction interpret
  
  - hash
  - status
  - block
  - timestamp
  - from / to
  - value
  - transaction fee
  - gas price / gas limit / usage by Txn / gas fees (Base, Max, Max Priority) / burnt

> (gas is a unit of computational measurement. The more complex your transaction, the more gas you have to pay.) (gas prive √ó gas usage = transaction fee) (Ether and Gwei converter: https://eth-converter.com/)

- Blockchain demo: [Blockchain Demo](https://andersbrownworth.com/blockchain/)
- SHA256 Hash
- Genesis Block (the first block in a blockchain)
- Mining
- Block
- Nonce: a bumber used to find the solution of the blockchain
- Private Key & Public Key ([Blockchain Demo: Public / Private Keys &amp; Signing](https://andersbrownworth.com/blockchain/public-private-keys/))
- Signature

# Session 3, Fundamentals

- Consensus

- Chain Selection

- Sybil Resistance: such as PoW (Miner), PoS (Validator)

> PoS nodes put up (stake) some collateral that they're going to behave honestly.

- ETH (PoW), ETH 2.0 (PoS)

- Block time

- Sybil Attack

- 51% Attack (Reference: ETH Classic and ETH)

- Nakamoto consensus: PoW and longest chain rule

- Transaction fee + block reward

- Block confirmations

- Randomness is important in blockchain

- Scalability (lack of blockchain space and high gas fee)

- ‚ùìSharding (a solution to solve scalability problem)

- Layer 1: Base layer blockchain implementation (such as BTC, ETH)

- Layer 2: Any application built on top of a layer 2 (such as chainlink, arbitrage, optimism)

- ‚ùì Rollups: Some layser 2 (such as arbitrage) roll up their transactions into a layer on like ETH

- Side chains: It is different from rollups. Their derive their security from their own protocols instead of base layers.
