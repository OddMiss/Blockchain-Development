- Create pictures (or other vitual assets)
- Generate Metadata for each assets (json file)
- Upload to IPFS

> Original asset and metadata for NFT is too big to be efficiently stored on blockchain. Instead, we store it in offchain in the interplanetary file system (IPFS). Each file in the IPFS has a identifier. Also, the file is immutable. Therefore, we can store identifer in NFT.

In this tutorial, we use [Pinata](https://pinata.cloud/), which is a free IFPS.
